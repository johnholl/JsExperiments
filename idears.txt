Overall strategy for now will to be create single pages which each focus on an individual algorithm.

Some algorithms:
X maze solver
X tree visualization
* breadth first search on a tree
* inverting a binary tree
* doing stuff with linked lists like swapping, reversing, sorting
* sorting array (insertion, selection, merge, etc)
* tabular RL algorithms
* simple adaptive strategies
* simple ic simulation
* linear regression

What would it take to allow others to make these?
Option 1 -- directly contributing to repo
    - typescript
    - a little bit of reorganizing files so things are in logical spots
    - documentation/walkthrough

Option 2 -- tools on the webapp itself for building experiences
    - how to specify graphics?
    - how to translate user specs into refs
