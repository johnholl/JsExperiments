Overall strategy for now will to be create single pages which each focus on an individual algorithm.

Some algorithms:
X maze solver
X tree visualization
* breadth first search on a tree
* inverting a binary tree
* doing stuff with linked lists like swapping, reversing, sorting
* sorting array (insertion, selection, merge, etc)
* tabular RL algorithms
* simple adaptive strategies
* simple ic simulation
* linear regression
